                    <p>As you enter info about where you spend the most money per month (and how much) this website essentially plugs in your information into each credit card in the site's database and finds the top 3 cards where you earn the most $ cashback.

                    <p>By researching each card, I have used available information to figure out what your minimum credit score has to be in order to be approved. Note that other factors are considered during credit card applications, but typically some cards have a minimum FICO score, +/- 40, that informs you whether you have a good chance of approval.</p>

                    <ul>
                    	<li><b>A word of Caution</b>
                    		<p>Credit cards are like products, just like any other product you would pay for. The companies make money off of you any time you carry a balance and have to pay interest on that balance. They really want you to use your card for everything and if possible, make you spend money excessively on things you might not otherwise pay for just to increase the likelihood that you'll carry a balance.</p>
                    	</li>
                    	<li><b>Rewards</b>
                    		<p>Credit card companies offer percentage-based cashback rewards to make spending money like a game. The more money you spend, the more you get back. Except the more money you spend, the less money you have, so...watch out for that.</p><br>
                    		<p>When choosing a card, you basically want something that gives you the highest possible reward for categories where you already spend the most money. If you spend the most money per month on groceries and gas, then those are the reward categories you're looking for when shopping for credit cards.</p>
                    	</li>
                    	<li><b>Annual Fees</b>
                    		<p>Some cards have really high reward rates (3%-6%) but charge an annual fee. <b>But is it worth it?</b> This is where you need to be able to forecast how much you spend in a year. A card with a high annual fee might just make you break even in spite of really high reward rates. Fortunately, this site does all that work for you as long as your monthly spending amounts are accurate and consistent. Note that if the card has a 12-month delay on the annual fee, canceling it right before day 365 <i>could</i> get you off the hook for the fee.</p>
                    	</li>
                    	<li><b>Other Benefits</b>
                    		<p>In the "Other Information" section at the bottom of each card section, read carefully what some of the benefits are. These blurbs aren't comprehensive because there's a ton of info about each card, but I've culled the details that stand out. By clicking through the link, you can learn more about what the card has to offer, like free rental car insurance or extended warranties for purchases.</p>
                    	</li>
